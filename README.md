# Martin Alvarado – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. My name is **Martin Alvarado**, and this repository showcases my practical, hands-on experience in cybersecurity. After completing the *Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate*, I began developing real-world projects that demonstrate my ability to analyze incidents, secure systems, and apply industry-standard frameworks.

This portfolio will continue to expand as I gain more experience and build new tools, reports, and security automations.
